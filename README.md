### How to use?

Simply click on a component, copy the code and paste it into your project. This will give your application extra sophistication!

### Inspiration

My biggest inspiration for creating components comes from looking at [Vercel](https://vercel.com/home) websites, such as [Next.js](https://nextjs.org), which is fascinating when it comes to user experience.

I would like to thank [ui.ibelick](https://ui.ibelick.com), who was a fundamental inspiration for the creation of this project.

### Future plans

I was very excited to develop this project, it's a great satisfaction to be creating it, I intend to continue and add more and more components and make web development easier.
